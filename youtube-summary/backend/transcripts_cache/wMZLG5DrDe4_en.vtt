00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
like that and you know you could and
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.990 align:start position:0%
like that and you know you could and
they<00:02:50.080><c> were</c><00:02:51.040><c> expected</c><00:02:51.440><c> to</c><00:02:51.680><c> be</c><00:02:51.840><c> equally</c>

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
they were expected to be equally

they were expected to be equally

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.509 align:start position:0%

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
running a numbers racket, you know,
 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
running a numbers racket, you know,
every<00:02:57.760><c> day</c><00:02:57.920><c> would</c><00:02:58.160><c> have</c><00:02:58.319><c> the</c><00:02:58.560><c> same</c><00:02:58.800><c> expectancy</c>

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
every day would have the same expectancy
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.949 align:start position:0%
every day would have the same expectancy
of<00:02:59.680><c> that</c><00:02:59.840><c> I</c><00:03:00.280><c> would</c>

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 align:start position:0%
of that I would
 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
of that I would
keep<00:03:02.959><c> 40%</c><00:03:03.519><c> of</c><00:03:03.760><c> whatever</c><00:03:04.080><c> the</c><00:03:04.239><c> handle</c><00:03:04.560><c> was.</c><00:03:04.959><c> And</c>

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
keep 40% of whatever the handle was. And
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.949 align:start position:0%
keep 40% of whatever the handle was. And
so<00:03:05.519><c> the</c><00:03:05.760><c> only</c><00:03:05.920><c> question</c><00:03:06.239><c> would</c><00:03:06.400><c> be</c><00:03:06.560><c> is</c><00:03:06.720><c> how</c>

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
so the only question would be is how
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.190 align:start position:0%
so the only question would be is how
much<00:03:07.280><c> we</c><00:03:07.640><c> transacted.</c><00:03:08.640><c> But</c><00:03:08.800><c> we're</c><00:03:09.040><c> not</c>

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
much we transacted. But we're not
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
much we transacted. But we're not
running<00:03:09.360><c> that</c><00:03:09.599><c> kind</c><00:03:09.680><c> of</c><00:03:09.840><c> a</c><00:03:10.000><c> business.</c><00:03:10.879><c> And</c><00:03:11.120><c> so</c>

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
running that kind of a business. And so
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
running that kind of a business. And so
we're<00:03:11.519><c> running</c><00:03:11.680><c> a</c><00:03:11.920><c> business</c><00:03:12.239><c> which</c><00:03:12.480><c> is</c><00:03:12.800><c> very</c>

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
we could uh we'd end up doing better
 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
we could uh we'd end up doing better
