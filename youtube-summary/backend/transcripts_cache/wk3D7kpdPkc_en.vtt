00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.750 position:98% line:92%
Currently, in the face of the international trend of unilateralism and power bullying, China will, together

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.050 position:56%
with Russia, shoulder the
responsibilities of world powers and

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.870 position:61%
permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.580 position:63%
We will uphold the correct view of World
War Two history, safeguard the authority

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.090
and status of the United Nations,
resolutely defend the rights and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.380 position:61%
interests of China, Russia and other
developing countries, and work together

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.870
to provide an equal and orderly
world.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.490 position:56%
Multi polarization and the inclusive
economic globalization.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.500 line:92%
The two presidents here.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.670 position:58%
Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking
during that bilateral meeting with

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.680 position:56%
President Putin over in Moscow.
Let's get more on what took place at

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.070 position:61%
that meeting in the Russian capital and
the key takeaways there.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.140 position:61%
China correspondent Minmin Low has been
covering the story for us.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.740 position:56%
Is this still a no limits friendship
between the two?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.120 position:59%
Well, if you want a very visual way to
see how close the two countries are,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.080 position:63%
just watch the May 9 parade at the
Red Square today, because Chinese troops

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.370 position:61%
are the largest foreign contingent that
are participating in the parade.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.390 position:64%
That's after Kiev, actually told or asked
foreign countries not to send military

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.770 position:61%
troops to participate in that parade.
And while neither leaders mentioned the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.610 position:63%
no limit friendship, but President Putin
did say that their friendship is, quote,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.280
unbreakable.
The two leaders still calling each

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.700 position:56%
other, dear friends, there is a long
list of things that they agree on.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.690 position:58%
If you look at their joint statement,
both calling out, you know, the US

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980 position:58%
export controls as a means to contain
other countries.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.140 position:61%
Also calling out the eastward expansion
of NATO as well as the U.S.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.390 position:58%
Indo-Pacific strategy as big
destabilizes for this region and also

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.040 position:63%
calling for jointly opposing this dual
containment strategy of China and Russia

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.970 position:63%
and the smearing of China, Russia ties
because they seem very keen to highlight

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.240 position:61%
that their ties are not directed at any
third parties.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.600 position:56%
President Putin saying that both
countries have their own independent

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.010 position:61%
foreign policy making is just that they
are brought together by this common

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.080 position:61%
vision of creating a multipolar world.
And it's not just about tone, it's also

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.690
about substance, because they also
signed some deals.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.600 position:61%
Trade reached $245 billion dollars last
year, which the leader said is not just

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.690 position:59%
a new high.
It's not a it's a it's a new high, but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.050 position:56%
it's not a new feeling.
And, you know, they say they've meet

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.810
some progress on a potential gas
pipeline deal.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.640 position:63%
And President Putin pledging to create a
more favorable condition for Chinese

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.630 position:61%
companies and also welcoming Chinese
carmakers to build factories in Russia.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.890 position:63%
This comes after Russia actually imposed
higher import charges on Chinese car

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.250 position:56%
makers that led to a fall in Chinese
exports to Russia.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.380 position:63%
The timing of this is also very
interesting in the sense that you've got

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.150 position:63%
this meeting going on between Russia and
China just ahead of China meeting with

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.790
the U.S.
to to start trade negotiations.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920 position:58%
We're also understanding perhaps that
there's going to be a request from

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.460 position:59%
Washington for assistance from Beijing
when it comes to Ukraine.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.120 position:63%
Yes, Trump said that he's going to raise
that with presidency and actually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.440 position:56%
presidency did raise this issue with
Putin as well.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.660 position:63%
The question is how much leverage he has
in actually influencing Putin.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.780 position:63%
And he says he expects Russia to cut a
fair deal with Ukraine and that any deal

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.590 position:61%
will have to have the agreement of both
parties through mutual dialogue.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.600 position:59%
But he also reiterated that the root
cause of this issue must be addressed.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.590 position:63%
The legitimate security concerns of that
war must be addressed.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.390 position:63%
And I guess he is referring back to that
expansion of Natal, as he has pointed

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.720 position:61%
out in the past.
And the question now is, you know, with

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.250 position:63%
Trump perhaps a little bit more amenable
to a solution that is more favorable to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.240 position:63%
Russia, freezing the lines, the conflict
of the current lines and leaving some of

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.150
the territory in Russian hands that
perhaps provide an opening.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.900 position:63%
But what complicates matters now is that
now that President Trump has signed that

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.830 position:59%
minerals deal with President Zelensky,
his tone has also softened towards

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.370 position:61%
Ukraine.
So where sort of that shift the balance

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.740 position:58%
of power is going to shift is still a
big question mark.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.950 line:92%
You.
