1. Cover the ENTIRE video content (unless the video is over 2 hours, then you may summarize the first 2 hours)
2. Divide the content into sections based on natural topic shifts in the transcript
3. Start each section with an ACCURATE timestamp (MM:SS format) directly from the transcript markers
4. Present timestamps in STRICT chronological order (from beginning to end)
5. For videos under 60 minutes, provide more detailed coverage with appropriate length for the language:
   - For English: 20-30 words per minute of video
   - For Chinese: 30-50 characters per minute of video
   - For other languages: adjust accordingly to ensure comprehensive coverage
6. Focus on main points, keep explanations brief but comprehensive

Example format:
0:00 - Brief description of this section
2:15 - Brief description of another section

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each line in the transcript has a timestamp in the [MM:SS] format. USE THESE TIMESTAMPS to mark the beginning of your summary sections.
- If the video has chapters, use those chapter timestamps as primary section dividers.
- For videos without chapters, identify natural topic shifts in the transcript and use the timestamps at those points.
- Your summary MUST cover the complete video content in chronological order.
- Ensure balanced coverage - don't focus too much on early parts and rush through later parts.
- For shorter videos (under 60 minutes), provide more detailed coverage of key concepts.
